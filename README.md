## Project Overview  
Our project is aimed at optimizing seismic event detection and data transmission on planetary surfaces, particularly on Mars. By deploying algorithms directly on planetary landers, we reduce the volume of data transmitted back to Earth by identifying relevant seismic signals. This method allows for efficient use of bandwidth while ensuring critical information is preserved. 

Additionally, we analyze seismic data to determine optimal locations for constructing a sustainable Martian base.

### Key Features
- **Seismic Event Detection**: Real-time signal processing using STA/LTA and MFT algorithms to distinguish seismic activity from noise.
- **Machine Learning**: Integration of ML techniques to clean seismic records and enhance event detection in noisy environments.
- **Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Detects seismic events even in low signal-to-noise environments typical of planetary surfaces.
- **Future Application**: Analysis of seismic data to identify safe and optimal locations for building Martian bases.
- **3D Visualization**: Mars surface rendering to help visualize safe construction zones.
