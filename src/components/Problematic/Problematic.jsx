However, its unpredictable seismic events and harsh conditions mean we need to carefully plan where and how we build. Understanding where these seismic zones are can help prevent structural failures in buildings and infrastructures designed for Mars colonization. By analyzing the seismic data, Namazu provides a clear view of the most stable regions of
             the planet for construction, contributing to the safety and longevity of settlements.</p>
