                <p>The following images display the processed seismic data collected from Mars missions. Using advanced signal processing techniques, we have filtered out the noise, allowing for a clear and concise representation of the seismic activity detected on the planet. These visualizations highlight key 
                    regions affected by Marsquakes, showcasing both the intensity and frequency of seismic events.</p>
                <p>Each graph offers insights into the seismic landscape of Mars, helping to identify safer areas for construction and potential zones for energy generation. By analyzing this data, future missions can make informed decisions about where to build infrastructure and harness energy from seismic movements.</p>
                <p>The clean, noise-free data presented here is essential for understanding the seismic dynamics of Mars and ensuring the success of human settlements on the Red Planet.</p>
